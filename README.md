Navigator
=========

A small Selenium program with shell script to automatically download a .csv
file of the job postings that are on 
[Laurier Navigator](http://navigator.wlu.ca) and immediately see any changed
job application status. I installed a link to `compare.sh` to my `bin`
directory and used `job-applications` on the terminal to check the status of my
co-op applications without having to log in to Navigator.
